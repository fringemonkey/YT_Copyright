# Security Policy

If you discover errors, misleading guidance, or anything that could enable harmful automation, please open a **private** security report (or email the maintainer). Do not post exploit-like details publicly.

We do not accept contributions that add automation for sending notices, scraping recipients, or evading platform defenses.
