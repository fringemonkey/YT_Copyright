## üîç **Verification Request**

### **What I want verified:**

- [ ] **Other:** [Describe specific concern]

### **My technical comfort level:**

- [ ] **Advanced** - I can review code and run analysis tools

### **Specific concerns:**
[Describe any particular worries about privacy, safety, or transparency]
