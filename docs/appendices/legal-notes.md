# Legal Notes (Pointers only; not advice)
- **Fair use** must be considered before sending takedowns/claims (see Lenz v. Universal, 9th Cir. 2015).
- Disputes should evaluate context (purpose, amount, effect); trivial or incidental use in commentary weighs toward fair use.
- Keep counsel involved for counterâ€‘notices and escalation strategies.
