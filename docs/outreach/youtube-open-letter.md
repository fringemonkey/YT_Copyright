# Open Letter to YouTube (Draft)

We ask YouTube to implement the following changes to reduce harm from automated copyright claims against commentary/educational content:

1. **Escrow monetization** during disputes (neither claimant nor creator receives funds until resolution).
2. **Minimum match‑duration + alignment thresholds** for music commentary to avoid trivial matches.
3. **Human review** for high‑volume claimants and channels flagged as educational/press.
4. **Exportable claim logs** (machine‑readable) including timecodes, durations, claimant identifiers, reversal metrics.
5. **Template throttling** to limit duplicate, boilerplate claims in small time windows.
