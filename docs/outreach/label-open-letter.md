# Open Letter to Labels/Agents (Draft)

We urge rights‑holders and their agents to adopt the following:

1. **Verified rights‑scope declarations** per claim (work, territory, time window, exclusivity) with penalties for overreach.
2. **Human review** for creator channels engaged in education/critique/interview formats.
3. **Publish error/reversal rates** and maintain corrective procedures.
4. **Throttle templated mass‑filings** and include clear timecodes + durations with each claim.
