# Outreach Templates - Safe & Effective Project Promotion

## üéØ **Outreach Strategy Overview**

This document provides safe, effective templates for promoting the Content ID Defense Kit while minimizing personal and legal risks.

### **Core Principles**
- **Project Identity:** Use repository links and project email, not personal contact
- **Neutral Tone:** Focus on "documenting patterns," "seeking accuracy," "welcoming corrections"
- **No Accusations:** Don't accuse specific companies/individuals of illegality
- **Clear Requests:** Include specific asks like "sanity-check the Evidence Kit" or "try the synthetic demo UI"
- **Legal Disclaimers:** Always include NOTICE and "not legal advice" disclaimers

## üìß **Email / Contact Form Templates**

### **Template 1: Personal Outreach to Creator Channels**

**Subject:** Quick sanity-check on a Content ID documentation kit

```
Hi [Name] ‚Äî

I'm a systems engineer (~20 years) and music die-hard. I built a small, docs-only kit to help creators document automated claim patterns safely (no takedown tools, no scraping).

Repo (docs + synthetic demo UI): https://github.com/fringemonkey/YT_Copyright

What I'm asking: 5 minutes to skim the Evidence Kit and tell me what's missing or unclear.

Why you: your videos dissect this problem better than anyone.

This is informational only (not legal advice). If it's useful, feel free to share or file issues/PRs.

Thanks either way,
Wes

### **Template 2: Legal/Policy Professional Outreach**

**Subject:** Content ID automation documentation toolkit - seeking expert review

```
Hi [Name] ‚Äî

I'm a systems engineer who's built a documentation toolkit for creators facing automated copyright claims. The goal is evidence collection and pattern recognition, not legal advice or automation.

Repository: https://github.com/fringemonkey/YT_Copyright

I'm seeking expert review of the Evidence Kit and Counsel Brief sections to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Key areas for feedback:
- Evidence collection methodology
- Legal strategy recommendations
- Policy advocacy approaches

This is informational only (not legal advice). All materials include appropriate disclaimers.

Would you be willing to review and provide feedback?

Thanks,
Wes
