## 📧 **Email Templates**

### **Template 1: Personal Outreach (Safe & Friendly)**

**Subject:** Quick question about content protection tools

Hi [Name],

I'm a systems engineer (~20 years) and music enthusiast. I built a small toolkit to help creators **protect themselves** by documenting automated copyright claims safely.

**What it is:** A privacy-focused toolkit for documenting what happens to your content
**What it's NOT:** A takedown tool, scraping tool, or legal advice

**Repo:** https://github.com/fringemonkey/YT_Copyright

**What I'm asking:** 5 minutes to look at the Evidence Kit and tell me what's missing or unclear.

**Why you:** Your videos discuss this problem better than anyone, and I want to make sure the toolkit actually helps creators.

**This is informational only** (not legal advice). If it's useful, feel free to share or file issues/PRs.

Thanks either way,
Wes
