# Evidence Kit (Creator Checklist)

## Preserve
- Claim emails (PDF) **and** raw `.eml` with headers (DKIM/SPF, `Received`, `Message‑ID`, `X‑Mailer`).
- Creator Studio/YouTube dashboard screenshots (claim details, policy, timecodes, durations).
- Local copies of the video, transcript, edit notes stating purpose (critique/education/news).
- Analytics & revenue snapshots before/after claims.

## Log (spreadsheet template provided)
- UTC timestamps for claim, appeal, response(s), resolution.
- Video URL/ID; segments/timecodes claimed; claimed duration; policy applied.
- Claimant (entity + agent); claim ID(s); sequential patterns if any.
- Notes on duplicate language or clustered arrivals.

## Integrity
- Hash all PDFs/CSVs/EMLs (SHA‑256) and store alongside files.
- Store copies in a write‑once or versioned bucket; avoid edits to originals.

## When appealing
- Cite transformative purpose and minimal necessary excerpts; point to timecodes.
- Request human review; ask for rights‑scope evidence and match duration.

## Red flags to capture
- Claims with **< 5–10s** matched duration, **no timecodes**, identical boilerplate text, dense bursts, or rapid re‑filings.
