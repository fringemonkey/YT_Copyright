- **üì∏ Document claims safely** - Screenshots and logs that protect you
- **üîí Keep evidence private** - Your information stays on your device
- **üõ°Ô∏è Build protection** - Evidence you can use if needed

## üö® **Why Redaction Matters - Your Privacy Protection**

### **üõ°Ô∏è Redaction is Your Shield**

**Think of redaction as putting a privacy filter on your evidence.** It's like:
- **üì∏ Taking a photo** but blurring out personal details
- **üìù Writing a note** but using placeholders for sensitive info
- **üîí Creating a safe copy** that protects your privacy

### **üéØ What Redaction Protects:**
- **Your identity** - names, addresses, contact info
- **Financial details** - revenue amounts, subscriber counts
- **Private information** - internal codes, personal data
- **Your channel** - specific URLs, IDs, timestamps

### **‚úÖ What Redaction Preserves:**
- **Claim patterns** - timing, frequency, language
- **Impact evidence** - policy types, duration data
- **Automation indicators** - template reuse, burst timing
- **Fair use context** - content type, educational value

**Redaction lets you share evidence safely while keeping your private information private.**

## üìã **Proven Redaction Methods**

### **Method 1: Digital Redaction (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Evidence**
1. **Save original files** in a secure, private location
2. **Create working copies** for redaction
3. **Use PDF format** when possible (harder to reverse)

#### **Step 2: Apply Redaction**
1. **Use Adobe Acrobat Pro** or **PDF-XChange Editor** (free)
2. **Select "Redact" tool** (not highlight or black rectangle)
3. **Mark sensitive text** with redaction tool
4. **Apply redaction permanently** (this cannot be undone)
5. **Save as new file** with "_REDACTED" suffix

#### **Step 3: Verify Redaction**
1. **Try to copy/paste** redacted text (should fail)
2. **Use text search** to ensure sensitive terms are gone
3. **Check file properties** for any metadata leaks

### **Method 2: Screenshot Redaction**

#### **Step 1: Capture Screenshots**
1. **Take screenshots** of relevant platform pages
2. **Use high resolution** (1920x1080 minimum)
3. **Include context** but avoid sensitive areas

#### **Step 2: Edit Screenshots**
1. **Use Paint.NET, GIMP, or Photoshop**
2. **Draw solid black rectangles** over sensitive areas
3. **Use consistent black color** (#000000)
4. **Extend beyond text boundaries** to prevent edge detection

#### **Step 3: Save Safely**
1. **Save as PNG** (lossless, harder to reverse)
2. **Use descriptive names** without sensitive info
3. **Verify no sensitive data** is visible

### **Method 3: Text Document Redaction**

#### **Step 1: Create Safe Version**
1. **Copy original text** to new document
2. **Replace sensitive data** with placeholders:
   - `[REDACTED_NAME]` for names
   - `[REDACTED_AMOUNT]` for financial data
   - `[REDACTED_DATE]` for specific dates
   - `[REDACTED_ID]` for platform IDs

#### **Step 2: Use Consistent Placeholders**
```
Original: "Claim from UMG Rights Ops for $150 revenue loss on video ABC123"
Redacted: "Claim from [REDACTED_COMPANY] for [REDACTED_AMOUNT] revenue loss on video [REDACTED_ID]"
```

#### **Step 3: Maintain Context**
- **Keep claim patterns** visible
- **Preserve timing relationships** (relative, not absolute)
- **Maintain policy information** (monetize/track/block)
- **Document duration data** (seconds/minutes, not timestamps)
