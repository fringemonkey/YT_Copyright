## üîí **Safe Evidence Redaction Guide**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Why Redaction Matters**

**Never share unredacted evidence publicly.** Even seemingly harmless details can:
- **Identify you personally** to potential harassers
- **Reveal your location** or other private information
- **Expose your financial situation** (revenue, subscriber counts)
- **Provide ammunition** for legal threats or platform retaliation
- **Violate others' privacy** if you mention other creators

### **üõ°Ô∏è Redaction Standards (Follow ALL)**

#### **ALWAYS Redact:**
- **Personal identifiers:** Full names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- **Financial information:** Revenue amounts, subscriber counts, view counts
- **Location data:** Cities, states, countries, time zones
- **Platform IDs:** Channel IDs, video IDs, claim IDs
- **Timestamps:** Exact dates/times (use relative: "3 days ago")
- **Claimant details:** Company names, representative names, contact info
- **Internal references:** Platform internal codes, system messages

#### **SAFE to Share:**
- **Claim patterns:** "Multiple claims within 5 minutes"
- **Duration data:** "Claims on segments under 10 seconds"
- **Policy types:** "Monetization redirected," "Content blocked"
- **General timing:** "Claims during business hours only"
- **Template analysis:** "Identical claim text used 5+ times"

## üìã **Proven Redaction Methods**

### **Method 1: Digital Redaction (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Evidence**
1. **Save original files** in a secure, private location
2. **Create working copies** for redaction
3. **Use PDF format** when possible (harder to reverse)

#### **Step 2: Apply Redaction**
1. **Use Adobe Acrobat Pro** or **PDF-XChange Editor** (free)
2. **Select "Redact" tool** (not highlight or black rectangle)
3. **Mark sensitive text** with redaction tool
4. **Apply redaction permanently** (this cannot be undone)
5. **Save as new file** with "_REDACTED" suffix

#### **Step 3: Verify Redaction**
1. **Try to copy/paste** redacted text (should fail)
2. **Use text search** to ensure sensitive terms are gone
3. **Check file properties** for any metadata leaks

### **Method 2: Screenshot Redaction**

#### **Step 1: Capture Screenshots**
1. **Take screenshots** of relevant platform pages
2. **Use high resolution** (1920x1080 minimum)
3. **Include context** but avoid sensitive areas

#### **Step 2: Edit Screenshots**
1. **Use Paint.NET, GIMP, or Photoshop**
2. **Draw solid black rectangles** over sensitive areas
3. **Use consistent black color** (#000000)
4. **Extend beyond text boundaries** to prevent edge detection

#### **Step 3: Save Safely**
1. **Save as PNG** (lossless, harder to reverse)
2. **Use descriptive names** without sensitive info
3. **Verify no sensitive data** is visible

### **Method 3: Text Document Redaction**

#### **Step 1: Create Safe Version**
1. **Copy original text** to new document
2. **Replace sensitive data** with placeholders:
   - `[REDACTED_NAME]` for names
   - `[REDACTED_AMOUNT]` for financial data
   - `[REDACTED_DATE]` for specific dates
   - `[REDACTED_ID]` for platform IDs

#### **Step 2: Use Consistent Placeholders**
```
Original: "Claim from UMG Rights Ops for $150 revenue loss on video ABC123"
Redacted: "Claim from [REDACTED_COMPANY] for [REDACTED_AMOUNT] revenue loss on video [REDACTED_ID]"
```

#### **Step 3: Maintain Context**
- **Keep claim patterns** visible
- **Preserve timing relationships** (relative, not absolute)
- **Maintain policy information** (monetize/track/block)
- **Document duration data** (seconds/minutes, not timestamps)
